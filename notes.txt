width of channel = e
width of bar = h
thickness of bar = i
spacing between bars = j
angle of inclination = n

liquid depth of screen = f
width inside the screen = k


freeboard card = p : 


output >> 
area = e*f = g
approach velocity = y/g = v 
Effective one spacing width = j/2 + j/2 + h = l
No of spacing = k/l = m
No of bars = m+1 = m1
Effective width of screen = k-(m1 * h) << done till here





 
inclined height = f/sin n
total height of the screen = platform screening (1) + e + f
effective screen area = inclined height *   effective width of the screen (screenW)


velocity through the screen = z (flow = x) /screenW * inclined height 
length of the screen occupied by inclination = total height of the screen / tan(n)
upstream length = 1.1 * e 
downstream length = 0.7 * e
Total length of chamber (required)= length of the screen occupied by inclination + upstream length + downstream length
total length provided = round off required 


headers through clean screen = velocity through the screen * velocity through the screen - approachVel * approachVel / 2 * 9.81 * 0.7


velocity through clogged screen = velocity through the screen / 0.5


screen at clogging condition = velocity through the screen * velocity through the screen - approachVel * approachVel / 2 * 9.81 * 0.6
volume of screening = 67 * angle of inclination (n) * 1000000 / 1000000 (L unit)
total volume of screens = total height of screen / 1000
